  <h3>How it all started</h3>
  <p>
    Ever since I was young before even kindergarten, I was already surrounded by games. My parents were pretty huge gamers before, influencing both me and my older brother. I would stay up all night and morning playing on our old PS2, Xbox and Wii Consoles, but mostly on my dad’s work laptop.
    So at a pretty young age I was already staring at the TV or the laptop screen not even knowing how to properly read, I've played hundreds of different games with very different genres with my brother or with random players online.<br>
    That’s how I got hooked into computers. I didn't know what computers were, but I was enjoying it.

  <h3>Growing up</h3>
  <p>
    As I got older, I didn’t just play games, I started messing, rather trying to understand how the machine I'm playing on actually work. I learned how to take apart and put back together our computers, my smartphone, and other electronic gadgets at home. (with the supervision of my dad or older brother, of course)
    So far, I’ve built three PCs for me and my younger siblings, most parts handed to me by my older brother whenever he decides to upgrade parts of his own PC. I'm the one who benchmarks, cleans, check the temps and changing the thermal paste to fixing issues whenever something broke or needed troubleshooting.<br>
    All of that gave me a lot of practical knowledge and confidence when it comes to computers.

  <h3>The struggle</h3>
  <p>
    Programming was always something I wanted to learn, but honestly, my lazy personality and lack of motivation held me back.<br>
    That’s why I enrolled in ICT for senior high, expecting CSS and programming. Instead, I got CSS and animation... which wasn’t really my thing.<br>
    My drawings were bad, but I still pushed through and graduated.

  <h3>What now?</h3>
  <p>
    After graduating, I was contemplating whether to continue through college or get some actual work experience. But my parents heavily emphasized that I really need a college degree, so here I am. The options were Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or Information Technology.<br>
    I dropped Computer Engineering right away since my older brother already took that path.<br>
    Between Computer Science and IT, I read up on both and found out that Computer Science leans more on theories and math, while IT is more practical. Since I like the hands-on side of things, I decided to go with IT.

   <br>
    <h3>And that's why I chose Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</h3>
